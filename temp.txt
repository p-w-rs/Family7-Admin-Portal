using elm-ui and the uploaded files make me a navbar widget that is contained to it's own file, the nabber widget takes the path of an image which is used as a image link to go to a specified url, and it takes a list of other names and their respective url links.

The image link should be on the left of the nabber the other links should hug the right, everything should be spaced nicely and look good
